# Fading Footprints: Global Migration Incident Analysis

## Project Overview
Fading Footprints is a comprehensive data analysis project that investigates global migration incidents, with a focus on missing migrants. The project aims to uncover patterns, identify dangerous routes, and provide insights that could influence global migration policies.

## Key Features
- Analysis of 13,360 migration incident records from 2014 to 2023
- Investigation of economic and social factors driving migration
- Predictive modeling for future migration incidents
- Visualization of migration patterns and incident locations

## Data Source
The project utilizes data from the International Organization for Migration (IOM), comprising 25 variables related to migration incidents.

## Methodology
1. Data Processing:
   - Data retrieval and cleaning
   - Addressing missing values
   - Categorizing causes of death
   - Outlier detection and removal

2. Data Analysis:
   - Geographical analysis of incident locations
   - Economic factor analysis (GDP, inflation, unemployment)
   - Investigation of social and environmental migration drivers

3. Predictive Modeling:
   - Time series analysis for future incident prediction
   - Consideration of seasonal patterns and major events

## Key Findings
- Identified patterns in incident locations and migration routes
- Analyzed the impact of economic factors on migration from countries like Afghanistan, Mexico, and Guatemala
- Recognized the influence of factors such as family reunification, climate change, and human rights concerns on migration
- Developed predictions for future migration incidents

## Future Scope
- Enhance predictive models with advanced analytics
- Expand partnerships for more comprehensive data collection
- Develop proactive response strategies based on insights
